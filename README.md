## :gear: Application Configurations

### Seeding sample data
would happen once you run the application, including Test Accounts:
  - Patient: patient@patient.com / password: 123456
  - Doctor: doctor@doctor.com / password: 123456
  - Admin: admin@admin.com / password: 123456

However, Rating Seeding has to be done by the Admin once the rest of the data has been seeded. This can be done from the "Import Ratings" button on the home page.
